Overview

This project analyzes customer shopping behavior using Python, SQL, and Power BI to uncover insights about purchasing patterns, product preferences, and customer loyalty.
As a Data Analyst Fresher, I created this project to showcase my ability to handle real-world datasets, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), write optimized SQL queries, and visualize insights in an interactive dashboard.

Objective

To understand:

How gender, age, and subscription status affect purchase behavior

Which products perform best based on sales and reviews

How discounts, shipping types, and previous purchases influence spending

Revenue distribution across different customer segments

Tools & Technologies Used
Purpose	Tools
Data Analysis	Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
